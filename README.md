A Sublime Text 2/3 Plugin to manage WordPress 3.5.1+ websites.


It's a mostly quick panel based system for managing settings, posts, pages and taxonomy terms of a WordPress blog.

To start, you'll need to setup a WordPress site config to connect to. A settings file has been created for you in your 
<sublime package dir>/User/ folder. To edit it open the command palette and look for "WP: Manage Sites". A snippet has
been provided to make it easy to add new configurations, you can complete it by typing "site" without the quotes 
and pressing tab. You can continue pressing tab to cycle through the various options.

After adding a site connect to by finding "WP: Connect to Site" in the command palette. From there it should be relatively
easy to figure out. Beware it is under heavy construction still.
